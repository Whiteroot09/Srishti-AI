Key features include highly accurate speech recognition, support for multiple languages, real-time transcription and translation, customizable vocabulary and voice commands, intelligent voice assistant integration, and secure and private data handling. SRISHTI serves as a valuable platform for students and IT professionals to learn and grow in a fun and engaging way.

We are committed to the continuous improvement of Srishti AI by leveraging the latest advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Expect regular updates and enhancements to further refine your speech recognition experience.

### Motivation

Speech recognition technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, from searching for songs to resolving queries and doubts. While currently limited to relatively simple commands, technological advances are paving the way for more intelligent systems capable of understanding conversational speech. Imagine talking to your computer in a natural manner, receiving reasoned responses back—this vision is made possible by signal processing technologies like SRISHTI.

The demand for specialists in this field is growing, with numerous companies seeking talented individuals passionate about shaping the future. Processing, interpreting, and understanding speech signals are key to unlocking powerful new technologies and communication methods. The speech recognition technology, driven by SRISHTI, is poised to be a fast-growing and world-changing subset of signal processing in the years to come.

### Scope of the Work

The proposed website of SRISHTI is a web application that gives opportunities to students. This system manages complete information in a single interface and dictation paired with transcriptions software means reduced transcription costs and a much easier workflow. Voice recognition software can be used by any industry or hospital. Have more time to focus on your patients and clients. Work from anywhere with a secure internet connection. The range of this application is very wide and diversified from industry to home applications. The intentions of the system are to reduce the complexity of specially-abled persons. Besides this, it is accessible to local people who find difficulties using smartphones, laptops, etc. In addition to being precise and accurate, speech recognition technology can detect accents and spell words accurately.

### Background of the Work

A review of literature is the section of any research study which provides a critical view and detailed overview of all the magnitudes of the specific subject of study, which has already been exposed over different gaps. Computing powers and artificial intelligence are largely behind these spaces. With a massive amount of speech recognition has hit an inflection point where its capabilities are roughly on par with humans.

The first speech recognition systems were focused on numbers, not words in the late 1950s and 1960s. In 1952 Bell Laboratories designed the “Audrey” system which could recognize a single voice speaking digit allowed. In 2011, Apple launched ‘Siri’ which was similar to Google Voice Search, the early part of the decade saw an explosion of some other voice recognition apps and software. Today, some of the largest tech components are competing to herald the speech accuracy title.

This technology voice application is now relatively inexpensive and powerful, With advancements in AI and the increasing amounts of speech data that can be mined, it is very possible that voice becomes the next dominant interface.

### Objective

- This system helps to know about the SRISHTI interface is feasible and crucial for usability. efficiency, correctness search tells me about how this interface will help to propagate neural networking, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and Python modules and Python programs and further search.
- Decreased billable hours on searching.
- Improved productivity and a more streamlined workflow for the entire team More work is done throughout the work week so working after hours and on weekends becomes a thing of the past
- No more missing important events because you have to work
- It provides support information for any queries in the mind of a beginner who has just started any new topic.
